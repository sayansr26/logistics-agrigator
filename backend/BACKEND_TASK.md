# Backend Development Tasks

## **Task Management System**

All backend development MUST follow this task-based approach for proper tracking and accountability.

---

## **Task Format Template**

```markdown
### Task ID: [SERVICE]-[NUMBER] (e.g., USER-001, SHIP-002)

## **TASK MANAGEMENT RULES**

### **Before Starting Any Task**

1. **Update Status** to `IN_PROGRESS`
2. **Review Dependencies** - ensure all prerequisites are met
3. **Read Planning Section** - understand objective and approach
4. **Check Implementation Details** - review all subtasks

### **During Task Development**

1. **Follow Established Patterns** - use auth-service as reference
2. **Update Subtasks** - mark completed items with [x]
3. **Document Issues** - note any problems or deviations
4. **Test Continuously** - verify each component works

### **After Task Completion**

1. **Update Status** to `COMPLETED`
2. **Fill "What Was Actually Implemented"** - detailed summary
3. **List All Files Modified/Created** - complete file list
4. **Update Dependencies** - mark this task complete for dependent tasks
5. **Review Next Task** - check if ready to start

### **Task Status Definitions**

- **NOT_STARTED**: Task not yet begun
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Currently working on task
- **COMPLETED**: Task finished and verified
- **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues

### **Task Naming Convention**

- **Service Prefix**: USER, SHIP, PLAT, SUPP, API
- **Sequential Numbers**: 001, 002, 003, etc.
- **Examples**: USER-001, SHIP-003, PLAT-001

### **Documentation Requirements**

- **Planning**: Must be detailed and clear
- **Dependencies**: All prerequisites listed
- **Implementation**: Specific subtasks defined
- **Completion**: Actual results documented

---

## **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Start with AUTH-001** - Auth Service Prisma Schema (FOUNDATION)
2. **Complete AUTH-002 through AUTH-007** - Full authentication system
3. **Then move to USER-001** - User Service (depends on working auth)
4. **Follow task sequence** - complete dependencies first
5. **Update this file** - mark progress and completion

**Current Priority**: ✅ Auth Service COMPLETED! Now proceed with User Service (USER-001) and other services.

**Auth Service Completion**:

- ✅ All 7 auth tasks completed and production-ready
- ✅ 10 endpoints fully documented with Swagger UI
- ✅ Complete JWT authentication and RBAC system
- ✅ Health monitoring and comprehensive audit logging
- ✅ Foundation ready for all other microservices

**Last Updated**: August 21, 2025 (Auth Service archived)
**Current Active Task**: Ready for USER-001 (User Service development)
